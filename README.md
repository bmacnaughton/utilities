# bruce's personal and half-baked utilities

- clone - clones objects recursively. handles 99% fairly well.
- configuration - the start of a configuration utility to handle env vars and command-line.
- quick-look.sh - looks at repos in my source structure to summarize statuses
- set-operations - half-baked set manipulation. needs some work.
